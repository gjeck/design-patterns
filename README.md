# Design Patterns
Design pattern practice in a few languages. Mostly OOP stuff, but I'll try
to throw in a few functional too.

## What is this balderdash?
In essence, design patterns in software are like design patterns in any other
field. They are common patterns that have proven useful by experience and 
nothing more.

[Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/) defines them as follows:
- Descriptions of what experienced designers know 
- Hints/reminders for choosing classes and methods
- Higher-order abstractions for program organization
- To discuss, weigh and record design tradeoffs
- To avoid limitations of implementation language

## Build Details
How to run these things!

### Java
Projects are scaffolded using Gradle. To build/test run:
```Bash
gradle build
```
### (More to come later... hopefully)
