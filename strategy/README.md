# Strategy Pattern

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them 
interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from 
clients that use it.

## Related design principles
- Identify aspects of applications that vary and separate them from
what stays the same
- Program to an interface, not an implementation
- Favor composition over inheritance

### Java build notes
Projects are scaffolded using Gradle. To build/test run:
```Bash
gradle build
```
